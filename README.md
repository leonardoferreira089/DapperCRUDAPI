# DapperCRUDAPI
Simple Web API project created to practice Dapper.

Dapper is a micro ORM born in 2011.
It is one of the fastest and simplest around, yet it is very extensible and, above all, well adopted and used in very high-performance websites.

I Created this simple API to practice its implmentation and basics persistences.
